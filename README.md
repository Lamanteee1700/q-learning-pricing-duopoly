This project is based on my master's thesis in economics: **Collusive Outcomes in a Sequential Pricing Duopoly with Q-Learning Agents**

*Abstract*

*Recently, automated pricing algorithms relying on reinforcement learning methods have achieved outcomes above the competitive benchmarks in oligopoly markets. This occurs although there is no communication between pricing algorithms. This recent evolution of pricing systems, also known as algorithmic collusion, challenges the current understanding of collusive behaviors when games are played by automated agents.
Using Q-learning methods, we investigate how the size of the price grid influences automated agents’ pricing strategies in a sequential pricing duopoly. The simulation models this market design as a dynamic programming problem of an infinitely repeated sequential pricing game inspired by Maskin and Tirole (1988) and its adaptation to Q-learning by Klein (2021). Our findings suggest that the size of the price grid affects AI-pricing agents’ average profits and their behaviors, especially the way a player chooses to undercut his rival or not. These results not only widen theoretical knowledge of automated eco-
nomic agents but are also crucial for real-world markets where automated agents predominate, such as in financial trading and online retail. A better understanding of automated pricing behaviors would help to renew the regulatory approaches to AI-driven markets.*
